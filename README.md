# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a response to a challenge to make a rock, paper, scissors game agains the computer using Javascript. It was my first time creating something from scratch using JS and went smoother than I imagined.

The first challenge was trying to figure out how to randomize the computer's choices. Once I learned how to create a simple function that selects a random integer inbetween any two integers (in this case 1-3). It was fairly straightforward. 
From there it was a matter of creating a series of if..else statements to decide the winner. I tried to complete this with as few lines of code as possible. I then created a loop to play the game five times. After setting that up it was a matter of using a prompt() to get the users choices and setting up alert()s to keep them in the loop :).

I finally came back to this project to add a (very) simple user interface. The game updates the user with DOM methods of the current score and of who won each round. At the end of the game, the game disables itself and presents a reset button to start over.
